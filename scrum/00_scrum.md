### <a name="conv_devel"></a>Conventional Development

#### Waterfall Model

Most common process for software development.  All requirements must be 
identified and defined in the beginning, and modifications to these 
parameters is costly.

  1. Requirements
  1. Analysis
  1. Design
  1. Coding
  1. Software Products

#### Iterative Incremental Model

Repeat the Waterfall Model multiple times incorporating new features with 
each iteration.  The user is not involved in the design process.

### <a name="agile_devel"></a>Agile Development

This method is based off the Iterative Incremental Model with a time-boxed 
iterative approach.

#### Goals

  - faster time to deliver
  - reduce uncertainty and risk
  - increase return on investment by focusing on customer value

#### Agile Manifesto
"We are uncovering better ways to developing software by doing it and 
helping other do it.  Through this work, we have come to value:

  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we vaalue the items
 on the left more."

##### Agile Manifesto Items
  - Individuals and Interactions
    - self-organization and self-motivation of the team members continuous
    interaction for work, clarifications, information among the team members
  - Working Software
    - Delivery of working software at short duration intervals helps gain 
    customer trust and assurance in the team
  - Customer collaboration
    - Constant involvement of customer with the development team ensures 
    communication of necessary modifications
  - Responding to change
    - Focus on quick response to the proposed changes, which is made 
    possible wth short duration iterations

##### Authors
Beck, Kent, et al. (2001)

#### Agile Methodologies

##### Dynamic System Development Methodology (DSDM)

##### Scrum

  - focuses on management of tasks within a team environment
  - uses iterative incremental method
  - quick and frequent deliveries
  
##### Extreme Programming (XP)

  - frequent releases
  - short development cycles
  - allows new customer requirements to be adopted

##### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

  - tests are written first
  - minimal amount of code to pass the test is written
  - once software is working code is cleaned up to acceptable standards

##### Lean

  - the expenditure of resources not adding value to the end customer are 
  targeted for elimination
  - focus on preserving value with less work
  
##### Kanbon

  - system to improve and keep up a high level of production

### <a name="scrum"></a>Scrum
Scrum is a framework that defines certain rules, events and roles to bring 
in regularity.  Every event in the frame work has a maximum time duration.

#### Sprint

  - 2 week or 1 month cycles
  - work to be performed in the Sprint is planned collaboratively by the team
  - daily 15 minute meeting to plan for that day
  - Sprint review is held at the end of the Sprint

#### Roles
  - ScrumMaster
    - makes the process run smoothly
    - removes obstacles that impact productivity
    - organizes the facilitates the critical meetings
  - Product Owner
    - this is a single person not a committee
    - manages the product backlog
    - prioritizes the product backlog
    - optimize the team
  - Team
    - keep team between 5 - 9 people
      - fewer than 5 members decreases interaction and results in smaller 
      productivity gains
      - more than 9 members requires too much coordination
    - ensures smooth flow of information and the quick resolution of issues
    - maximize opportunities for feedback
