### <a name="development_process"></a>Development Process

  - Define the problem to be solved
    - "What" are you going to solve
  - Design a solution
    - "How" are you going to solve the problem
    - Good Solutions:
      - Are straightforward
      - Are well documented
      - Are built in a modular structure
      - Are robust
  - Write a program that implements the solution
  - Compile the program
  - Link Object files
  - Test and debug program

### <a name="argument_incrementing"></a>Argument Incrementing

#### ++

  - adds 1 to an argument
  - position matters
    - ++n will increment n before the line is evaluated
    - n++ will increment n after the line is evaluated
  - can only be used on single variables
    - (n + m)++ would be illegal

### <a name="assignments"></a>Assignments

  - use a single equals symbol to assign a value to a variable.

```C
handle = value;
```

[Table of Contents](#toc)

---

### <a name="comments"></a>Comments

  - comment lines are ignored by the compiler
  - comments may be declared in three different ways

```C
/* multiple line
   comment */

/* single line comment */

// single line comment
```

### <a name="data_types"></a>Data Types

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| char | character (a single byte) |
| short | short integer |
| long | long integer |
| double | double (precision floating point) |

### <a name="division"></a>Division

  - integer division will truncate
    - same behavior as Python 2

### <a name="for_loop"></a>For Loop

  - loop must have a body

```C
for (initialization; condition; step) {
    body
}
```

### <a name="header_files"></a>Header Files
Header files are used to import libraries into the current module.
The syntax to include files varies depending on the type of library being 
imported.

  - Standard libraries are surrounded by less than and greater than symbols 
  (< >). This tells the compiler to search in pre-defined system directories.
  
  - User libraries are surrounded by double quotes (" ").

```C
#include <std_lib.h>
#include "user_lib.h"
```

### <a name="print_to_terminal"></a>Print to Terminal

#### printf
  - to display information to the terminal use the **printf** command
  - command must be ended with a **;**

##### Escape Characters
  - escape characters in the string argument have special meanings
   
| Character | Meaning |
| --------- | ------- |
| \a | alert bell |
| \b | backspace |
| \f | form feed |
| \n | newline |
| \r | carriage return |
| \t | horizontal tab |
| \v | vertical tab |
| \\ | backslash |
| \? | question mark |
| \' | single quote |
| \" | double quote |
| \ooo | octal number |
| \xhh | hexadecimal number |

##### Conversions

```C
printf("%conv", value)
```

| Character | Argument Type | Printed As |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| d, i | int | decimal number |
| o | int | unsigned octal number (without a leading zero) |
| x, X | int | unsigned hexadecimal number (without a leading 0x or 0X), using abcdef or ABCDEF for 10, ..., 15|
| u | int | unsigned decimal number |
| c | int | single character |
| s | char *| print characters from the string until a '\0' or the number of characters given by the precision |
| f | double | [-]m.dddddd, where the number of d's is given by the precision (default 6)
| e, E | double | [-]m.dddddde&plusmn;xx or [-]m.ddddddE&plusmn;xx, where the number of d's is given by the precision (default 6) |
| g, G | double | use %e or %E if the exponent is less than -4 of greater than or equal to the precision; otherwise use %f (trailing zeros and a trailing decimal point are not printed) |
| p | void * | pointer (implementation-dependent representation) |
| % | None | print % symbol |

- Adding characters before the conversion character can modify the display 
state.

| Preceding Character | Meaning |
| ------------------- | ------- |
| - | left alignment of a field |
| + | number will always be printed with a sign |
| space | if the first character is not a sign a space will be prefixed |
| 0: | for numeric conversions, specifies padding to the field with leading zeros |
| # | alternate output form; 1) for o first digit will be 0; 2) for x, X 0x or 0X will prefix a not-zero result; 3a) for e, E, f, g, G the output will always have a decimal point; 3b) for g, G the trailing 0 will not be removed |
| number | a number specifying a minimum field width. The converted argument will be printed in a field at least this wide and wider if necessary. If converted argument is fewer characters than the field width it will be padded with spaces unless the 0 padding flag is present. * will calculate value. |
| period | separates the field from the precision |

### <a name="read_strings"></a>Read Strings

#### getchar()

  - gets a single character from a text stream

#### putchar()

  - gets a single character from a text stream

#### End of File

  - EOF
  - EOF is an integer defined in <stdio.h>

### <a name="symbolic_constants"></a>Symbolic Constants

  - symbolic constants are text names that replace values
  - conventionally use all UPPER CASE for the name
  - do not end line with a semicolon

```C
#define NAME value      // description of constant
```

### <a name="while_loops"></a>While Loops

  - indent the commands within a statement
  - if only a single command is to be run the braces {} are not required
    - always use the braces {} for consistency

```C
while (statement) {
    command
}
```

### <a name="variables"></a>Variables

  - variables must be declared before they are used
  - a declaration consists of a type name and list of variables of that type

```C
int var_1, var_2;
```

  - a single character written between single quotes represents an integer 
  value equal to the numerical value of the character
