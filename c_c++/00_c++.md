### <a name="data_types"></a> Data Types

| Type        | Meaning                            | Minimum Size          |
|-------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| bool        | boolean                            | N/A                   |
| char        | character                          | 8 bits                |
| wchar_t     | wide character                     | 16 bits               |
| char16_t    | Unicode character                  | 16 bits               |
| char32_t    | Unicode character                  | 32 bits               |
| short       | short integer                      | 16 bits               |
| int         | integer                            | 16 bits               |
| long        | long integer                       | 32 bits               |
| long long   | long integer                       | 64 bits               |
| float       | single-precision floating-point    | 6 significant digits  |
| double      | double-precision floating-point    | 10 significant digits |
| long double | extended-precision floating -point | 10 significant digits |

- use **unsigned** type when the values cannot be negative
- use **int** for integer arithmetic
    - *short* is usually too small
    - *long* is usually the same size as int
- use **long long** for integer arithmetic of large numbers
- do **not** use plain **char** or **bool** in arithmetic expressions
    - use plain versions of these types to only hold truth values
        - compilers view the plain **char** inconsistently (sometimes signed,
         sometimes not)
- use **signed** or **unsiged** **char** for tiny numbers
- use **double** for floating-point computations
    - **float** usually does not have enough precision
    - usually using double is faster than float
- use **long double** only when necessary
    - considerable run-time cost will be incurred when this type is used

### <a name="design_process"></a> Design Process

1. What is the problem I'm trying to solve?
    1. Every program should have a clear, well-articulated goal.
1. Can this be accomplished without resorting to writing custom software?

### <a name="executable_files"></a> Executable Files

Process to create an executable:
1. create source code (.cpp)
1. compile the source code to generate an object file (.obj)
1. link the object file to any required libraries

### <a name="file_extensions"></a> File Extensions

The following files extensions are in common use.

- **Source Code**
    - .cpp (most common)
    - .cp
    - .cc
    - .c
    - .C
    - .cxx
- **Object Files**
    - .obj
- **Executable Files**
    - .exe (Windows)
    - .out (UNIX)

### <a name="namespaces"></a> Namespaces

Namespaces may be declared inline or at the top of the file with the include
statements.

  - Inline will insure name collisions are avoided and is the preferred method.

**Inline**
```c++
// Description of Module
#include <iostream>

int main ()
{
    std::count << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```

**With Include Statements**
```c++
// Description of Module
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main ()
{
    count << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```

### <a name="OOP"></a> Object Oriented Programming

| Pillar | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| encapsulation | self-contained units of code (black box) |
| data hiding | understanding the code is not required to use it effectively |
| inheritance | an extension of an existing type |
| polymorphism | the idea that different objects do "the right thing" |
