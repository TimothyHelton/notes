### <a name="monday"></a>Monday
- Set a long-term goal
  - Be optimistic
- Write the long-term goal at the top of the whiteboard and leave it there 
all week.
- Now look at your long-term goal with a pessimistic view.
  - What can go wrong?
  - What are you assuming will go right?
- Create SPRINT questions
  - What questions do we want to answer in this SPRINT?
  - To meet our long-term goal, what has to be true?
  - Imagine we travel into the future and our project failed. What might 
  have caused that?
- Make sure the SPRINT questions are formed as questions and not statements.
  - This will allow you to look at the results on Friday and answer these 
  questions.
