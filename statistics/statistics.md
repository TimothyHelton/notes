## Bivariate Relationships

### Covariance

  - a descriptive measure of the linear association between two variables
  - only describes **direction** not magnitude
  - has no upper or lower boundary
  - covariance is **POSITIVE**, **NEGATIVE** or **ZERO**
  - positive covariance would be in quadrants I and III
  - Negative covariance would be in quadrants II and IV
  - When there is not a relationship between two variables the covariance 
  would be equal or near zero

## Correlation

  - Describes the **magnitude** and **direction** of an association
  - Denoted by the lowercase variable r
  - standardized measure of an association (-1 to 1)
  - only applicable to **LINEAR** relationships
  - **Correlation is NOT causation**
  - correlation strength does not necessarily mean the correlation is 
  statistically significant related to sample size
  - correlation is the covariance between the two variables divided by the 
  product of each variables standard deviation

### Rule of Thumb for Causation

If the following relationship is true then causation exists.

## Linear Regression

  - If you only have data for one variable then the best predictor for 
  future samples would be the mean value of the data.
  - **residuals** or **error** is the measure between individual data points
  to the best fit model.
